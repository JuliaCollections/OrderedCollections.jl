This package implements OrderedDicts and OrderedSets, which are similar to containers in base Julia.
However, during iteration the Ordered* containers return items in the order in which they were added to the collection.
It also implements `LittleDict` which is a ordered dictionary, that is much faster than any other `AbstractDict` (ordered or not) for small collections.

This package was split out from [DataStructures.jl](https://github.com/JuliaCollections/DataStructures.jl).
